# Wine-Quality-Predictions
Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

# Description

# Context
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
